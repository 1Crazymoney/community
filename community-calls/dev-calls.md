# Development Community Calls

If you are a third-party app developer or OSS contributor to the Filecoin project, you've come to the right place!

Our Development Community Calls, or dev calls, are monthly calls that give community members an opportunity to demonstrate recent work and discuss open problems and opportunities for contribution. These meetings can have a major impact on the future direction of the Filecoin project and ecosystem. All are welcome to attend. Please bring your demos, craziest ideas and toughest questions!

## Agenda items

Meeting agendas are posted as issues in this repo with the label [`agenda`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/labels/agenda). We will use these issues to ask for community member demos and nominations for agenda items to discuss. Anyone can propose an agenda item as long as it is:
- Related to Filecoin development specifically **or** related to apps that are developed on top of Filecoin. For now, dev calls are for all developers, but we may split out core Filecoin development calls from app development calls at some point in the future.
- NOT about project updates or roadmaps. There is a separate venue for these types of updates: our blog
