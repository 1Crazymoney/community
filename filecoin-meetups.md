# Filecoin Meetups

Filecoin meetups are a great way to meet and connect with other developers and miners in your community that are using and learning about Filecoin.  

**Please note:** We expect that all community members who attend Filecoin meetups follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). With repeated violations of the Code of Conduct, we will kindly request you to leave our community. This is extremely important, so we can make sure to maintain a warm and welcoming environment for everyone!

## Presenting

- Related to Filecoin development or mining specifically **or** related to apps that are developed on top of Filecoin. If you would like to present at a future meetup then please [submit a proposal](https://filecoin-community.typeform.com/to/Ue4sMVvw).
