## About

Welcome to the Filecoin community repository! You can treat this repo as your go-to for all meta, non-code discussions (in the [issues](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/issues)), documents used by multiple repositories (such as the Contributing guidelines), and how to interact with the Filecoin project and other community members.

**NOTE:** If you are interested in discussing code or protocol design, you can also open issues in specific repositories (like [go-filecoin](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-filecoin) and [fil-spec](https://github.com/filecoin-project/fil-spec)), and/or come talk to us on our #fil-dev [Slack](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/messages/CEHHJNJS3/)/[Matrix](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#fil-dev:matrix.org) channel.

## Discuss

You can interact with other community members and Filecoin devs/team members at the following channels:
- Community forum
- Chat (on Matrix/Slack)
- GitHub issues on various repositories

We are generally pretty responsive during normal business hours, which differ according to our timezones. We try to respond on the order of hours for questions posted to our chat channels, and on the order of days for questions on our community forum, although this is not a hard and fast rule! GitHub issues get prioritized every day or every other day, depending on the workflow of the team maintaining the repo.

We also push updates to the community via:
- Filecoin blog: https://blog.filecoin.io
- Twitter: [@MineFilecoin](https://twitter.com/MineFilecoin)
- Mailing Lists:
	- Filecoin Private Preview (Coming Soon)
	- Filecoin Community (Coming Soon)

### Community forum

https://discuss.filecoin.io

Use the community forum to ask questions with more persistent answers, e.g. specific install errors, protocol design questions, and so on. If you are just getting started with using Filecoin, the community forum is a good place to learn from some of the questions that others have answered. If you ask some of the Filecoin project maintainers questions that feel like they would be useful for more than 1 person, the project maintainers will likely direct you to this forum.

### Chat

We have soon-to-be-fully-public chat channels that we maintain through Matrix, a decentralized, end-to-end encrypted, open source communications protocol. We currently have three main channels:
- #fil-dev: Used for general dev chatter, and for specific discussions relating to the go-filecoin implementation
- #fil-dev: Used for proofs-related chatter
- #fil-chat: Used for general conversations about Filecoin, and also to make friends ðŸ‘‹

We also have a Filecoin Project Slack workspace, which includes a bridge to these three main Matrix channels as well. This means you can converse on the same channels using either Matrix or Slack. We prefer Slack because of its easy-to-use interface, so those links are listed first in the section below.

Here are all the relevant links:
- Filecoin Project Slack workspace: https://filecoinproject.slack.com
	- To join: Currently by invitation only
	- Channels:
		- [#fil-dev](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/messages/CEHHJNJS3/)
		- [#fil-proofs](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/messages/CEGB67XJ8/)
		- [#fil-chat](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/messages/CEGN061C5/)
- Matrix:
	- To join: Currently by invitation only
	- Our preferred client for Matrix is Riot, in either [web](https://riot.im/app/) or [desktop](https://about.riot.im/downloads/).
	- Channels:
		- [#fil-dev](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#fil-dev:matrix.org)
		- [#fil-proofs](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#fil-proofs:matrix.org)
		- [#fil-chat](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#fil-chat:matrix.org)

Note that you can generally think of the above options as one or the other. Both Riot and Slack have mobile, desktop, and web versions of the software and the channels we bridged are where most of the activity is happening. Note, however, that there are other channels that may crop up in Riot or in Slack that are not bridged, and therefore there may be slightly different information in the different communications spaces. Choose whichever one works best for you!

### GitHub issues

If you find something puzzling or encounter a straight-up bug in any of our repositories, please file a well-explained issue. The issue lists for our most active repositories is below:
-  [`go-filecoin`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-filecoin/issues)
- [`rust-proofs`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/rust-proofs/issues)
- [`fil-spec`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/fil-spec/issues)

### Security issues and disclosures 

Almost anything you find that is a bug in the codebase should be filed as an issue. The exception is if you find a security vulnerability. The Filecoin protocol is still under heavy development. This means that there may be problems in our protocol design or implementations. Though Filecoin is not yet production-ready, many people are already running nodes on their machines. So we take security vulnerabilities very seriously! If you discover a security issue, please bring it to our attention right away!

If you find a security vulnerability, please send your report privately to team@filecoin.io. Please DO NOT file a public issue.

If the issue is a protocol weakness that cannot be immediately exploited or has not yet been deployed, just discuss it openly.

## Events

You can add our Google Calendar (Coming Soon) to keep track of events (meetups, hackathons, etc.) hosted by the Filecoin Project.

You can also propose meetups or see meetups scheduled by other community members as issues (labeled with the `meetup` tag) on this repo [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ameetup).

## Contributing Guidelines

We use a common code of conduct across all of our repos:
- [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

Each repo should have its own contributing guide, called `CONTRIBUTING.md`. We have included links to a couple repo contributing guides here:
- [Contributing Guide for `go-filecoin`](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-filecoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
