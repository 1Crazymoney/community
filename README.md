## About

Welcome to the Filecoin community repository! You can treat this repo as your go-to for all meta, non-code discussions (in the [issues](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/issues)), documents used by multiple repositories (such as the Contributing guidelines), and how to interact with the Filecoin project and other community members.

**NOTE:** If you're interested in talking to developers about our overall project management, go to [filecoin-project/pm](https://github.com/filecoin-project/pm). If you are interested in discussing code or protocol design, you can also open issues in specific repositories (like [go-filecoin](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-filecoin) and [fil-spec](https://github.com/filecoin-project/fil-spec)), and/or come talk to us on [Matrix at #fil-dev:matrix.org](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#fil-dev:matrix.org).
